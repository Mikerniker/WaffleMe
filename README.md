# Waffle Me

WaffleMe is a simple interactive game built with Streamlit, where players need to make a quick 
choice between 'Waffle' and 'Hacker' buttons before the countdown ends. 
Players earn points if they correctly guess what is behind the question mark.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Streamlit installed on your system.

```
bash
pip install streamlit
```

This is a personal practice hack for the [Shenanihack](https://wafflehackstesting.devpost.com/) 
hackathon.
